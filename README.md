### Project Overview
This project was made on the basis of the templet we received and with the help of tutorials from the internet. Classes that have similar functionality are segregated into their respective packages. Project plan which is below helped in the organization of work .

<a name="Requirements"/>

### Project Requirements
Implement an isometric game that challenges a player to complete some type of quest. The game should end, with suitable celebration and fanfare, when the appropriate player action fulfills the quest. A set of stub classes that implements the basic features of an isometric game were provided, but deliberately badly designed. 

<a name="Aims"/>

### Aims and Objectives
Objective is to extend, modify and refactor the Object-Oriented Design Principles & Patterns code provided to create an elegant game design.<br></br>
Aims to accomplish:</br>
* Group together cohesive elements into methods, types and packages.
* Loosely-couple together all programme elements to the maximum extent possible.
* Create a reusable set of abstractions that are defined by interfaces and base classes.
* Encapsulate at method, type, package and module level.
* Apply creational, structural and behavioural design patterns throughout the game where appropriate. There are obvious uses for factories, builders, flyweights, observers and proxies in an isometric game.
* Use the Swing MVC framework to write custom sprites and game objects.

<a name="Plan"/>

### Project Plan:
1. Research about java game programming and Game Programming design patterns.
2. Collect useful links and books to complete the project.
3. Open project template in java 9 and make sure is running correctly.
4. Refactor and modify the project.
5. Add extra features(collision detection, map generation, animation etc).
6. Crate UML class diagram
7. Create jar file and test on other computer.
8. Generate JavaDocs.
9. Write README
10. Zip completed project

<a name="Main"/>

### Main Features:
* The game was rebuilt using modular programming approach. 
* User has to press start button to switch to a game.
* The map is read in from a text file where each tile has individual id number. 
* User cannot walk on water tile.
* The player cannot leave the map boarder.
* The game detects collisions with different objects and the player have to avoid objects such as tree or water.
